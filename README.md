## Exercise 1


## Exercise 2 & 3
I implemented ex 2 and 3 together. 

Remember that you need to run the following commends into the dir:
```
out/production/DistributedSystems2
```

For running the client
```
java -cp protobuf/protobuf-java-3.21.7.jar:. exercise2.Client2 0.0.0.0 [port]
```
For running the server
```
java -cp protobuf/protobuf-java-3.21.7.jar:. exercise2.Server [port]
```

If the dir "protobuf" is not present, download it from
```
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers
```
